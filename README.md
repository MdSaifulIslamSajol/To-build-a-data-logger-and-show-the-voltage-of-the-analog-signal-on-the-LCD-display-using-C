# To-build-a-data-logger-and-show-the-voltage-of-the-analog-signal-on-the-LCD-display-using-C
A Data logger is needed to be built. The voltage of the analogue signal will be recorded and
will be shown on the LCD display. When no samples have been recorded it will show dashes,
after the initialization of record it will start showing corresponding bar graphs in the upper
LCD line. The current sample will be displayed at the most right position and the previous
samples will be shifted to the left. All samples need to be shown on an internal buffer of 100
samples. The data logger will start the recording when button B will be presses, and it will stop
when button C is pressed. For the input voltage signal potentiometer 1 is used.
